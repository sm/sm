# S{cripting,ystem,tack} Management (SM) Framework (Core)

SM is a system scripting and DSL & management framework for managing software,
systems and stacks!

# Goal

SM delivers an extensible scripting framework providing a very robust DSL.
A primary tenet of SM is that it must handle as much pain as possible, so you don't have to!
With SM's DSL modules, you can quickly create your own high-quality extensions,
and expose their commands through SM's flexible command line interface (CLI).

# Architecture

SM itself is a scripting framework that enables very rich DSL sets known as
modules. SM lets you use the DSL to painlessly write powerful 'extensions', which are
essentially named sets of scripts (directories!). With SM, you'll find you can
install and manage a multitude of extensions - and even entire sets of extensions - providing
unprecedented levels of control and automation productivity that are unleashed by the
creative abilities of SM's energetic community of extension authors :)

# Quick Setup
    $ bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/seeflanigan/sm/master/bin/sm-downloader)

# Creating Extensions

There are only a few requirements when creating your own SM extensions.
The extension must live in a dedicated directory. Within this directory are
(at least) the subdirectory bin/, containing at least one executable file called 'help'.

Additionally, in the root of the extension directory you must include a text file called VERSION,
with a version number that follows semantic versioning convention (http://semver.org/);
that is, in the format of X.Y.Z, where X,Y and Z are positive integers.

An extension must also have a README file, in which you should explain your
extension's primary purpose, and any special considerations to be kept in mind
when using it.

The contents of the bin directory can be *any* executable file. This means, for
example, that C-compiled binaries, Ruby Scripts, python, lua, etc... may all be
used according to your requirements and preferences.

Of course, the extensions *I* write are generally in bash; but you can bring your
own implements of choice to the SM party ;)

Additionally, if you write your extensions in bash, a nice DSL is automatically loaded for you.
You can read more about the DSL in the online documentation.
