Description

  BDSM $(description)

Usage

  bdsm deploy <action> <<arguments>>

Actions

  $(actions)

Deployment Steps:

1. update_repository

2. deploy:

  a. stage
  b. configure
  c. symlink
  d. replace_current
  e. cleanup
  f. record

Hooks

  For each step there are two hooks one that is run before ('before_' prefix)
    and one that is run after ('after_' prefix).

  Each hook is the name of a step listed above prefixed with either before_ or
  after_.  For example around steps a - f there is a 'before_deploy' and an
  'after_deploy'

  If you want to execute a task before the code is moved in place but after
    everything is setup in the staging area, use 'before_replace_current' hook.



Notes

  If any one of the deployment steps fail, then the deploy should fail as well.
    If this is not the case please let me know right away and provide a gist of
    'bdsm --trace deploy' so that I can inspect where the failure is occurring.

Prerequisites

   - git
   - curl
   - rsync
   - subversion / mercurial (if the application's repository uses them).
