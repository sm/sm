# Temlpates are useful for many things. Examples include but are not limited
# to init scripts for services and default configuation files.
# Variables to be replaced use the {{variable_name}} syntax.
# You then use the template module's install_template and seed_template dsl
# functions to manage the template installation and content replacement.
